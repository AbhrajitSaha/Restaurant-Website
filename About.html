            <h1>Michelin Star Restaurant...</h1>
            <p>Yes, we were awarded the Michelin Star in 2020, which boasts of our deliverables, be it in terms of food quality, or decorum.
                Since then, we have been visited by Masterchefs like Sanjeev Kapoor, Vikas Khanna!
                <br><br>
                Our story started at the year 1940 during the turmoil of Indian Governance and economy. A trio of brothers (Mr.Ashutosh Saha, Mr.Ajay Saha, Mr.Sourav Saha) couldn't take the hardship of the people who were caught by the ill waves of war. Having only 10 Rupees of Indian currency, they set out for a noble cause of opening up a small food store at Park Street, Kolkata to supply fresh baked breads and tea for no money.
                <br><br>
                The trio survived with their family depending on supplies from local wheatstores, who were returned with delicious breads!
                With the dear blessings of the local people and support of Indian Wellness Committees, the trio expanded their menu and gained funds too.
                <br><br>
                Years passed, India became independent. The trio brothers upgraded to a well furnished restaurant and named it 'Restrau De Grande', thus the name since 1956.
                <br><br>
                In the year 1972, the restaurant was visited by then prime minister Smt. Indira Priyadarshini Gandhi, who had praised the trio's initiative to support the needy people and delivering quality food with at so low prices!
                <br><br>
                Since then, the restaurant kept flourishing and expanding all over India delivering the freshest food with the blessings of all.....
                Where we stand today.....
                Presently we have opened up branches in 9 big cities like Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Jaipur, etc. and are setting targets to represent our Indian culinary to foreign lands.
                <br><br>
                Apart from selling top notch fresh food, we have tied up with NGOs as well to supply free food to infants and homeless people.</p>
